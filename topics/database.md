# AWS Database Services

## Overview
AWS offers a diverse portfolio of purpose-built database services designed to meet the needs of different application requirements. Understanding the characteristics, use cases, and architectural considerations of each database service is crucial for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam.

## Database Evolution and Categories

### History of Enterprise Databases
Historically, database selection was a straightforward decision with limited options. Since the 1970s, relational databases have been the dominant choice, often selected before fully understanding the use case. Organizations typically standardized on a single database technology for all applications.

Today's approach is different, with applications being broken into smaller services, each using purpose-built databases suited to their specific needs. This shift from a one-size-fits-all approach to a complementary database strategy allows each workload to have appropriate functionality, performance, and scale.

### AWS Database Categories

AWS databases can be categorized based on data model and use case:

| Category | Data Model | AWS Services | Common Use Cases |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Relational | Tables with rows and columns | RDS, Aurora, Redshift | Transaction processing, analytics, traditional applications |
| Key-Value | Key-value pairs | DynamoDB | High-scale applications, session management, caching |
| Document | JSON documents | DocumentDB | Content management, catalogs, user profiles |
| In-Memory | In-memory structures | ElastiCache | Caching, session stores, real-time analytics |
| Graph | Nodes and relationships | Neptune | Social networks, fraud detection, knowledge graphs |
| Time Series | Time-stamped data | Timestream | IoT, DevOps, industrial telemetry |
| Ledger | Immutable transaction logs | QLDB | Financial records, supply chain, system of record |
| Wide Column | Tabular with flexible schema | Keyspaces | High-scale industrial apps, equipment maintenance |

## Understanding Relational Databases

### What is a Relational Database?
A relational database organizes data into tables, with relationships between them. Tables store data in rows and columns:
- **Table**: Collection of related data (e.g., Books, Authors, Sales)
- **Row/Record**: Contains all information about a specific entry
- **Column/Attribute**: Describes a specific characteristic of an entry
- **Relationship**: Connection between tables through common columns

Tables, rows, columns, and their relationships form a logical schema that is fixed once the database is operational, requiring most data modeling to be done upfront.

### Benefits of Relational Databases
- **Joins**: Connect tables to understand relationships between data
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Store data once and reference it from multiple tables
- **Familiarity**: Popular and widely understood since the 1970s
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability
- **Structured Format**: Well-defined schema enforces data integrity

### Common Use Cases
- Applications with stable, well-defined schemas
- Lift-and-shift applications migrating from on-premises to cloud
- Applications requiring ACID compliance:
  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems
  - Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications
  - Commerce and financial applications
  - Transaction processing systems

### Managed vs. Unmanaged Databases
When running databases on AWS, you have different management options:

#### On-Premises (Traditional)
- You manage everything: data center, hardware, OS, database, optimization
- Maximum control, maximum responsibility

#### Unmanaged (EC2)
- AWS manages: hardware and infrastructure
- You manage: EC2 instance, database installation, optimization
- More control, significant responsibility

#### Managed (RDS)
- AWS manages: hardware, infrastructure, database setup, high availability, scaling, patching, backups
- You manage: schema design, query optimization, data management
- Less control, less operational burden

## Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

### What is Amazon RDS?
Amazon RDS is a managed database service that handles routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair. This allows you to focus on high-value application development instead of managing infrastructure.

### Supported Engines
- **Commercial**: Oracle, SQL Server
- **Open Source**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
- **Cloud Native**: Amazon Aurora (MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible)

### DB Instances Explained
A DB instance is the fundamental building block of Amazon RDS, consisting of:
- An isolated database environment on AWS infrastructure
- The primary unit that runs a DB engine
- Can contain multiple databases with the same engine

DB instances run on EC2 instances managed through the RDS console, with three families available:
- **Standard**: General-purpose instances
- **Memory Optimized**: For memory-intensive applications
- **Burstable Performance**: Baseline performance with ability to burst to full CPU

### Storage Options
RDS uses Amazon EBS volumes for storage with three types available:
- **General Purpose (SSD)**: For most workloads
- **Provisioned IOPS (SSD)**: For I/O-intensive workloads
- **Magnetic Storage**: Legacy option (not recommended)

### Deployment Options
| Option | Description | Availability | Use Cases |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Single-AZ | One DB instance in one AZ | 99.5% | Dev/test environments |
| Multi-AZ | Synchronous standby replica in different AZ | 99.95% | Production workloads requiring high availability |
| Read Replicas | Asynchronous read-only replicas | N/A | Read scaling, reporting workloads |
| Multi-AZ with Read Replicas | Combination of both | 99.95% + read scaling | High availability with read scaling |
| Global Database | Cross-region read replicas | 99.95% + global reads | Global applications, disaster recovery |

### RDS in a VPC
When creating a DB instance:
1. Select the Amazon VPC where your database will live
2. Create a DB subnet group specifying AZs and subnets
3. Use private subnets without internet gateway routes
4. Control access with NACLs and security groups
5. Configure IAM policies to restrict actions and resources

### Backup and Recovery

#### Automated Backups
- Enabled by default
- Backs up entire DB instance and transaction logs
- Configurable backup window during low-activity periods
- Retention period: 0-35 days (0 disables and deletes existing backups)
- Supports point-in-time recovery (creates new instance with data from specific time)

#### Manual Snapshots
- User-initiated backups
- Exist until manually deleted
- Creates new DB instance when restored
- Useful for long-term retention (beyond 35 days)
- Ideal for compliance requirements

#### Best Practice
Use both automated backups (for point-in-time recovery) and manual snapshots (for long-term retention).

### Multi-AZ Deployments
- Creates synchronous standby replica in a different AZ
- Primary database in one AZ, standby copy in another AZ
- Automatic failover to standby if primary has issues
