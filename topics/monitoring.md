# AWS Monitoring and Optimization

## Overview
AWS provides comprehensive monitoring and optimization services that help you maintain the health, performance, and availability of your applications and resources. This guide covers key monitoring and optimization services with a focus on architectural considerations for the Solutions Architect Associate exam.

## Monitoring Fundamentals

### Why Monitoring Matters
Monitoring is the act of collecting, analyzing, and using data to make decisions about your IT resources and systems. It provides a near real-time pulse on your infrastructure and applications, enabling you to:

- Respond to operational issues proactively before they impact end users
- Improve performance and reliability of resources
- Recognize security threats and anomalies
- Make data-driven business decisions
- Create more cost-effective solutions

### Types of Metrics
Different resources generate different types of metrics:
- **EC2 instances**: CPU utilization, network traffic, disk operations, memory usage
- **S3 buckets**: Storage size, number of objects, request rates
- **RDS databases**: Connections, CPU utilization, disk space consumption
- **Custom metrics**: Application-specific data points like page loads, user counts, or business metrics

### Establishing Baselines
A baseline defines normal activity for your systems. Once established, you can:
- Detect anomalies that deviate from the baseline
- Configure alerts when metrics exceed normal thresholds
- Identify trends and patterns for capacity planning
- Determine if performance optimization efforts are effective

## Amazon CloudWatch

### Core Concepts
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides:
- **Data collection**: Metrics, logs, events, and traces from AWS and on-premises resources
- **Visibility**: Real-time and historical monitoring through dashboards
- **Alarming**: Automated notifications and actions based on metric conditions
- **Analysis**: Tools to inspect and correlate monitoring data

### Metrics and Namespaces
- **Metrics**: Time-ordered data points published to CloudWatch
- **Namespaces**: Containers for metrics (e.g., AWS/EC2, AWS/RDS)
- **Dimensions**: Name/value pairs that help identify a metric (e.g., InstanceId)
- **Statistics**: Aggregations of metric data (Sum, Average, Min, Max, etc.)
- **Resolutions**: Standard (1-minute) or high-resolution (1-second) data points

### Basic vs. Detailed Monitoring
| Feature | Basic Monitoring | Detailed Monitoring |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Data frequency | 5-minute intervals | 1-minute intervals |
| Cost | Free | Additional cost |
| Availability | Most AWS services | EC2, RDS, and some other services |
| Use case | General monitoring | Fine-grained analysis, faster alarm detection |

### CloudWatch Dashboards
- Customizable home pages for data visualization
- Support for multiple widgets (graphs, text, alarms)
- Multi-region view capability
- Shareable across users and accounts
- Live data support for real-time monitoring

### CloudWatch Logs
- **Log events**: Records of activity with timestamp and message
- **Log streams**: Sequences of log events from the same source
- **Log groups**: Collections of log streams with the same retention and permissions

### CloudWatch Alarms
Alarms monitor metrics and trigger actions based on thresholds:

#### Alarm States
- **OK**: Metric is within defined threshold
- **ALARM**: Metric is outside defined threshold
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA**: Not enough data to determine state

#### Alarm Actions
- Amazon EC2 actions (reboot, stop, terminate, recover)
- Auto Scaling actions (scale out, scale in)
- SNS notifications (email, SMS, etc.)
- Systems Manager actions
- Lambda function invocation

#### Alarm Best Practices
- Set appropriate thresholds based on historical data
- Define sufficient evaluation periods to avoid false alarms
- Configure meaningful actions based on the severity
- Test alarm configurations before relying on them
- Use composite alarms for complex conditions

### Custom Metrics
- Publish your own metrics using the PutMetricData API
- Standard resolution (1-minute) or high-resolution (1-second)
- Examples include:
  - Web page load times
  - Request error rates
  - Business-specific metrics
  - Application performance indicators

## High Availability and Reliability

### Availability Concepts
Availability is typically expressed as a percentage of uptime:

| Availability (%) | Downtime (per year) | Common Description |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 90% | 36.53 days | "one nine" |
| 99% | 3.65 days | "two nines" |
| 99.9% | 8.77 hours | "three nines" |
| 99.95% | 4.38 hours | "three and a half nines" |
| 99.99% | 52.60 minutes | "four nines" |
| 99.995% | 26.30 minutes | "four and a half nines" |
| 99.999% | 5.26 minutes | "five nines" |

### Availability Strategies
- **Redundancy**: Eliminate single points of failure with multiple resources
- **Multi-AZ deployment**: Distribute resources across Availability Zones
- **Active-Passive**: Standby resources take over when active resources fail
- **Active-Active**: Multiple resources actively serve traffic simultaneously
- **Automated recovery**: Systems automatically recover from failures

#### Active-Passive vs. Active-Active
| Aspect | Active-Passive | Active-Active |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Resource utilization | Only one set of resources active | All resources active |
| Scalability | Limited to capacity of active resources | Better scalability with load distribution |
| Stateful applications | Works well with stateful apps | Requires state synchronization |
| Cost-effectiveness | Less efficient resource utilization | Better resource utilization |
| Complexity | Simpler implementation | More complex implementation |

### Replication Considerations
- Configuration synchronization across instances
- Client redirection mechanisms
- Session state management
- Data consistency requirements

## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

### What is Load Balancing?
Load balancing distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, to ensure no single resource is overwhelmed.

### ELB Core Components
- **Listeners**: Define the port and protocol for connections from clients
- **Target Groups**: Collections of resources that receive traffic
- **Rules**: Determine how traffic is routed from listeners to target groups
- **Health Checks**: Verify target availability before routing traffic

### Types of Load Balancers

#### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Layer 7** (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancer
- **Key features**:
  - Path-based routing
  - Host-based routing
  - HTTP header and method-based routing
  - Query string parameter routing
  - Redirect and fixed responses
  - Authentication integration
  - TLS termination
  - WebSockets support
  - HTTP/2 support

- Limited by maximum instance size
- Suitable for applications difficult to parallelize
- More manual intervention required

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Add/remove instances to match demand
- No downtime during scaling operations
- Virtually unlimited scaling potential
- Requires stateless application architecture
- Can be fully automated

### EC2 Auto Scaling Components

#### Launch Templates
- Define the EC2 instance configuration:
  - AMI ID
  - Instance type
  - Security groups
  - Storage configuration
  - IAM instance profile
  - User data
- Support for versioning
- Can be created from:
  - Existing instances
  - Previous templates
  - New configuration

#### Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
- Define where and how many instances to deploy:
  - VPC and subnets for deployment
  - Minimum, maximum, and desired capacity
  - Load balancer integration
  - Health check configuration
  - Termination policies
  - Instance purchase options (On-Demand/Spot)

#### Capacity Settings
- **Minimum capacity**: Lower boundary for group size
- **Maximum capacity**: Upper boundary for group size
- **Desired capacity**: Target number of instances

### Scaling Policies

#### Simple Scaling
- Triggered by a single CloudWatch alarm
- Adds or removes a specified number of instances
- Waits for cooldown period before another scaling action
- Limited flexibility for complex scaling needs

#### Step Scaling
- Triggered by multiple alarm thresholds
- Different scaling actions based on metric magnitude
