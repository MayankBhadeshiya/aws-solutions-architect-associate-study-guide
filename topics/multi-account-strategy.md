# AWS Multi-Account Strategy and Governance

## Overview
AWS multi-account strategy is a critical aspect of enterprise cloud architecture, enabling organizations to effectively manage resources, security, compliance, and costs at scale. This guide covers key concepts, services, and patterns for creating a well-governed multi-account AWS environment for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam.

## Multi-Account Fundamentals

### Why Use Multiple AWS Accounts?
A multi-account strategy provides several benefits:
- **Security isolation**: Separate workloads with different security requirements
- **Billing separation**: Granular tracking and allocation of costs
- **Administrative isolation**: Limit the blast radius of administrative errors
- **Service quota management**: Independent service quotas for each account
- **Workload isolation**: Separate production from development and testing
- **Auditing**: Simplified compliance and auditing processes
- **Organizational agility**: Align accounts with business units or projects

### Key Benefits of a Multi-Account Strategy
- **Group workloads based on business purpose and ownership**:
  - Align ownership and decision-making for accounts
  - Avoid dependencies and conflicts between workloads
  - Isolate business units or subsidiaries with different processes
  - Ease divestment of business units over time
  - Simplify integration of acquired businesses

- **Apply distinct security controls by environment**:
  - Implement different policies for non-production and production
  - Separate resources and data by default through account boundaries
  - Apply environment-specific guardrails and compliance requirements

- **Constrain access to sensitive data**:
  - Limit sensitive data stores to purpose-built accounts
  - Implement least-privilege access more easily
  - Contain exposure to highly sensitive data
  - Enforce specific policies for data protection (e.g., preventing public S3 buckets)

- **Promote innovation and agility**:
  - Provide sandbox accounts for experimentation
  - Create development accounts with limited enterprise access
  - Support later stages with dedicated test and production accounts
  - Reduce dependencies between teams and workloads

- **Limit scope of impact from adverse events**:
  - Create logical isolation boundaries between resources
  - Reduce or eliminate impact to other workloads during incidents
  - Contain application issues, misconfigurations, or malicious actions

- **Support multiple IT operating models**:
  - Accommodate different operational responsibilities (Traditional Ops, CloudOps, DevOps)
  - Apply distinct governance and operational controls for each model
  - Maintain consistent ITSM goals across different models

- **Manage costs effectively**:
  - Simplify cost reporting, control, forecasting, and budgeting
  - Enable cost consolidation and reporting across all accounts
  - Apply fine-grained cost allocation with resource tagging

- **Distribute AWS service quotas and API request rate limits**:
  - Protect from unexpected or excessive resource provisioning
  - Spread API request limits across multiple accounts
  - Reduce the impact of service quotas on individual workloads

### Environment Types for Builder Innovation
- **Sandbox Accounts**:
  - Typically disconnected from enterprise services
  - No access to internal data
  - Provides maximum freedom for experimentation
  - Applies security guardrails and cost budgets

- **Development Accounts**:
  - Limited access to enterprise services and development data
  - Supports day-to-day experimentation with enterprise-approved services
  - Enables formal development and early testing
  - Maintains appropriate security boundaries

- **Test and Production Accounts**:
  - Separate environments for workloads or related workload groups
  - Reduces team dependencies
  - Minimizes impact of changes
  - Enforces stricter security and compliance controls

### AWS Account Structure Building Blocks
- **AWS Account**: Basic container for AWS resources
- **AWS Organizations**: Service for centrally managing and governing multiple accounts
- **Organizational Unit (OU)**: Logical grouping of accounts within Organizations
- **Root**: The top-level organizational unit that contains all accounts and OUs
- **Management Account**: The account used to create the organization
- **Member Account**: Any account in the organization that isn't the management account

### Account Structure Design Considerations
- **Business structure**: Align with organizational units, departments, or cost centers
- **Regulatory and compliance requirements**: Separate regulated workloads
- **Application portfolio**: Group related applications or services
- **Security requirements**: Isolate workloads with different security profiles
- **Operational patterns**: Consider deployment pipelines and DevOps practices
- **Auditing and monitoring**: Ensure consistent and comprehensive visibility
- **IT operating models**: Accommodate Traditional Ops, CloudOps, and DevOps approaches

## AWS Organizations

### Key Capabilities
- **Centralized management**: Create and manage multiple AWS accounts
- **Consolidated billing**: Single payment method and consolidated billing
- **Hierarchical organization**: Group accounts into OUs for easier management
- **Policy-based controls**: Apply policies at different levels of the hierarchy
- **Centralized identity**: Integration with AWS IAM Identity Center for centralized access
- **Shared services**: Enable resource sharing between accounts

### Organizational Structure
- **Root**: Top of the hierarchy, container for all accounts and OUs
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Nested structure for grouping accounts
- **Accounts**: Individual AWS accounts within the organization
- **Policies**: Control documents attached to accounts or OUs

### Tag Policies
- **Purpose**: Define tagging rules for resources across accounts
- **Capabilities**:
  - Define required tags
  - Specify allowed values
  - Enforce standardized naming conventions
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent resource tagging
  - Improved cost allocation
  - Enhanced resource organization
- **Implementation Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "tags": {
      "Environment": {
        "tag_key": {
          "@@assign": "Environment"
        },
        "tag_value": {
          "@@assign": [
            "Production"
          ]
        },
        "enforced_for": {
          "@@assign": [
            "ec2:instance"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Limitations**:
  - Prevents modification of tags but not creation of non-compliant resources
  - Works best with infrastructure as code for provisioning
  - Should be combined with SCPs for complete enforcement

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- **Purpose**: Define maximum permissions available to accounts
- **Application**: Applied at OU or account level (not to management account)
- **Inheritance**: Policies flow down the OU hierarchy
- **Effect**: Restricts permissions, never grants them
- **Evaluation**: Identity-based policies and SCPs evaluated together using a logical AND
- **Default**: FullAWSAccess SCP applied by default
- **Implementation Example for Tag Enforcement**:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "DenyCreateSecretWithNoProjectTag",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
          "Null": {
            "aws:RequestTag/Project": "true"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "Sid": "DenyRunInstanceWithNoProjectTag",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
          "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*"
        ],
        "Condition": {
          "Null": {
            "aws:RequestTag/Project": "true"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Common SCP Use Cases
