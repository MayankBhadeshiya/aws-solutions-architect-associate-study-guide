## Overview
This study guide is designed to help you prepare for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification exam. It covers key concepts, best practices, and exam-specific information.

## AWS Fundamentals

### What is AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud provider that delivers IT resources on-demand over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of maintaining your own hardware in physical data centers, AWS owns and maintains data centers and provides virtualized computing resources to users over the internet.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
1. **Pay as you go**: Pay only for the resources you use without upfront investment
2. **Economies of scale**: Lower costs due to AWS's massive scale
3. **Stop guessing capacity**: Scale up or down as needed without capacity planning
4. **Increased speed and agility**: Provision resources in minutes rather than weeks
5. **Focus on business differentiators**: Eliminate undifferentiated heavy lifting of infrastructure management
6. **Go global in minutes**: Deploy applications worldwide with minimal effort

### AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS's physical infrastructure consists of Regions and Availability Zones (AZs):

#### Regions
- Geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts data centers
- Named after their location (e.g., us-east-1 for Northern Virginia)
- Independent from each other (data is not replicated between regions without explicit permission)
- Selected based on:
  - Latency (proximity to users)
  - Price (varies by region)
  - Service availability (not all services available in all regions)
  - Data compliance (specific geographic requirements)

#### Availability Zones (AZs)
- One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- Located in separate facilities to isolate failures
- Connected via high-speed, low-latency links
- Named by appending a letter to the region code (e.g., us-east-1a)
- Foundation for high-availability architectures

#### Service Scope
- Region-scoped services: AWS manages availability across the region
- AZ-scoped services: User is responsible for architecting for high availability

### Interacting with AWS
Every action in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized. These API calls can be made through:

1. **AWS Management Console**: Web-based GUI for visual management
2. **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Text-based tool for scripting and automation
3. **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)**: Libraries for various programming languages to integrate AWS into applications

## Design Patterns Cheat Sheet

### High Availability Patterns
- **Multi-AZ**: Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones
- **Active-Active**: Multiple resources actively serving traffic
- **Active-Passive**: Standby resources take over when active resources fail
- **Pilot Light**: Minimal version of environment always running
- **Warm Standby**: Scaled-down version of full environment ready to scale up
- **Multi-Region**: Resources deployed across multiple AWS regions

### Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances as demand increases
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase resources for existing instances
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjust resources based on demand
- **Read Replicas**: Scale read operations for databases
- **Sharding**: Partition data across multiple databases
- **Caching**: Reduce load on backend systems
- **Stateless Design**: Enable any instance to handle any request

### Security Patterns
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security controls at different layers
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum permissions necessary
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Consistent, version-controlled deployments
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replace rather than modify
- **Secure Boundaries**: Segmentation and isolation of resources
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Detect and respond to security events

### Cost Optimization Patterns
- **Right Sizing**: Match instance types to workload requirements
- **Reserved Instances**: Long-term commitments for discounted pricing
- **Spot Instances**: Use spare capacity for non-critical workloads
- **Serverless Architectures**: Pay only for actual usage
- **Storage Tiering**: Move data to cheaper storage based on access patterns
- **Data Transfer Optimization**: Minimize cross-region/AZ data movement
- **Tagging Strategy**: Track and allocate costs to appropriate departments

3. **Eliminate obvious wrong answers**: Look for solutions that violate AWS best practices
4. **Compare remaining options**: Consider trade-offs between viable solutions
5. **Double-check assumptions**: Ensure your solution addresses all requirements

### Time Management
- 130 minutes for 65 questions = 2 minutes per question
- Mark difficult questions and return to them later
- Review all answers if time permits
- Don't leave any questions unanswered (no penalty for guessing)
